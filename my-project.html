		<strong><u>Overview</u></strong><br><br>
		For my project I am going to design and create an electric drum. The drum will be programmable via Bluetooth to a device with the required application installed. 
		In this application, the sounds the drum will output can be changed and manipulated by the user on an application.<br><br>
		<strong><u>Motivation</u></strong><br><br>
		I’ve been drumming for the last 15 years, during that time I’ve had many different financial circumstance and many different living arrangements. 
		Due to these varying circumstances, there have been times I have not been able to play my large 10 piece acoustic drum kit. So obviously I should buy an electric drum kit to fulfill my desires. 
		Being a student, I cannot afford a new electronic drumkit. This is the situation for many aspiring drummers.
		Having constant rhythm ideas and no way to transpose them, has motivated this project. 
		Now drummers who want to pursue their passion are able to do so without the burden of logistics and money. <br><br>
		<strong><u>Description</u></strong><br><br>
		The drum is going to resemble the shape of a typical snare drum. It will be responsive to standard acoustic drum sticks and touch, and the pad will be pressure sensitive to give it an authentic feel and experience. 
		The pressure pads will allow the user to hit with accents. 
		The accompanying application will allow the user many different features and functions.
